# news_sendiment_stock_predictor


## Goal:

Use news headlines and sentiment overnight to predict the next day's opening price jump.

## Method 

### 1. Collect News Headlines (After Market Close to Before Next Open)
Use APIs like:

- NewsAPI
- Twitter API
- Google News scraping (careful with TOS)
- Financial APIs (e.g. Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, SentimentInvestor)

Filter by:

- Company name
- Ticker
- Sector
- Market news


### 2. Apply NLP & Sentiment Analysis
Convert headlines to sentiment scores:

Lexicon-based methods:

- TextBlob, VADER (good for finance tweets/news)
- from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
- analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
- analyzer.polarity_scores("Apple shares drop after earnings miss")
  
ML-based models:

- transformers (e.g. BERT finetuned on financial text)
- Pretrained models from Hugging Face:
- finbert
- bert-base-uncased-finetuned-financial-news


### 3. Feature Engineering
Create features like:

| Feature                        | Example Value |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Avg sentiment last night       | +0.2          |
| # of negative headlines        | 3             |
| # of positive financial tweets | 20            |
| Volatility yesterday           | 0.025         |
| Close price                    | 150.00        |
| Next open - close (target)     | +2.20         |


### 4. Predict Overnight Jump (Regression or Classification)
Target: `Next_Open - Prev_Close`

Models:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LSTM (if using time series)
- Logistic Regression (to classify up/down)

### 5. Backtest or Simulate
Evaluate whether the signal would help you make trading decisions:

- Buy if model predicts `next_open > prev_close`
- Sell/short if `next_open < prev_close`
  
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, or even PnL (profit and loss) in simulation.

## Optional Enhancements

- Use earnings calendars and major event flags
- Include volume and volatility in features
- Combine with price-based technical indicators
